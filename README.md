# MicroPCF

MicroPCF is a new distribution of Cloud Foundry designed to run on a developerâ€™s laptop or workstation.  MicroPCF gives application developers the full Cloud Foundry experience in a lightweight, easy to install package.  MicroPCF is intended for application developers who wish to develop and debug their application locally on a full-featured Cloud Foundry.  MicroPCF is also an excellent getting started environment for developers interested in learning and exploring Cloud Foundry.

> More information about the project can be found on the [FAQ](FAQ.md#general-questions).

### Configuration

The following environment variables can be set during `vagrant up` to customize the MicroPCF deployment:

1. `MICROPCF_IP` - sets the IP address to bring up the VM on
  - defaults to 192.168.11.11 locally
  - defaults to AWS-assigned public IP on AWS
1. `MICROPCF_DOMAIN` - sets an alternate alias for the system routes to be defined on
  - defaults to `local.micropcf.io` when deploying locally
  - defaults to <MICROPCF_IP>.xip.io on AWS or when `MICROPCF_IP` is set
1. `VM_CORES` (local only) - number of CPU cores to allocate on the Guest VM
  - defaults to host # of logical CPUs
1. `VM_MEMORY` (local only) - number of MB to allocate on the Guest VM 
  - defaults to 25% of host memory

### Using the Cloud Foundry CLI

Follow the instructions provided at the end of `vagrant up` to connect to MicroPCF:

```
==> default: MicroPCF is now running.
==> default: To begin using MicroPCF, please run:
==> default: 	cf api api.local.micropcf.io --skip-ssl-validation
==> default: 	cf login
==> default: Email: admin
==> default: Password: admin
```

> `local.micropcf.io` above will show the domain configured for your MicroPCF instance.

To stage a simple app on MicroPCF, `cd` into the app directory and run `cf push <APP_NAME>`.
