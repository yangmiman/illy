# PCF Dev

PCF Dev is a new distribution of Cloud Foundry designed to run on a developerâ€™s laptop or workstation.  PCF Dev gives application developers the full Cloud Foundry experience in a lightweight, easy to install package.  PCF Dev is intended for application developers who wish to develop and debug their application locally on a full-featured Cloud Foundry.  PCF Dev is also an excellent getting started environment for developers interested in learning and exploring Cloud Foundry.

> More information about the project can be found on the [FAQ](FAQ.md#general-questions).
